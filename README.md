# Surfs Up Ice Cream

## Overview
Hawaii weather temperatures are going to affect how well we can predict the sales/rentals of our products in relation to the peak summer/winter seasons. While the island chain is a temperate, tropical climate, it still shares in its weather phenomenon. In our analysis, we are taking a look at how the temperatures of the months of June and December are over the years 2010 to 2017.

## Results
- Mean Temps only 5 degrees apart
- Standard Deviations half a degree apart
- Temps were 69 degrees or higher through 75% of our data


When looking at just the months of June and December, we find that the mean temperatures are within 5 degrees of each other. But the variance of those temperatures is a bit more in December with a standard deviation of 3.75 degrees versus the 3.25 degrees in June. That means we are more likely to see some colder temperatures in the island chain in December where we would see a dip in both ice cream sales and board rentals. That dip is to be expected as it is the winter months after all. However, due to the standard deviation being only a half degree difference, I expect the dip to be around 13% versus our peak summer months.

50% of the time for both the months of June and December, we saw temperatures at or above 70 degrees which is shorts and ice cream weather. 75% of the time, temperatures were above 69 degrees. Ultimately the venture of temperature affecting sales is going to be negligible versus the percipitation we might face in the island chain. Usually with more rainfall, we see less activity on the beaches from tourists.

## Conclusion
Ultimately the weather on the island chain of Hawaii is perfect. The location is a temperate, tropical feel with temperatures in the range where people would be outside enjoying the sun, surf, and our ice cream. To further prove this point, I would suggest looking at the month's average rainfall to determine if rain is going to be a factor on sales. Additionally, I would look at staging our store near the source of this data as that is where we have the most complete picture of the island of O'ahu specifically.

Finally to conifrm the results, a query of monthly data per year would be good to gauge the trend of the weather especially with regard to how the climate of the world is increasing. Warmer summers and colder winters could greatly affect future sales if the climate of Hawaii is shifting.
